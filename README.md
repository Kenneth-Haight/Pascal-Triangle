# Pascal-Triangle
//  Creates Pascal's Triangle using recursion reliably up to 15 rows
//  The program is recursive on line 38 by calling the method upon itself twice in its return method, which
//  essentially prints the triangles shape and fills in the numbers according to both the sum of the two recursive calls
